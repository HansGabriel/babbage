# Attention

Please do not rename files here, or flatten the directory structure. These
are structured for [scripty](https://github.com/testdouble/scripty).

If you do, make sure it syncs with `package.json`.

Also, try to make it OS-agnostic (e.g. using JS instead of `.sh`), for the sake
of our Windows-using teammates who can't use WSL 😁.

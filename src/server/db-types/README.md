# Generated typings for database

Code inside this folder is generated by [Kanel](https://github.com/kristiandupont/kanel).

It's different from the typings generated by GraphQL Codegen, since for one,
those contain relationships, and GraphQL thingies like `__typeName`, `nodeId`,
etc.

**More importantly**, the fields coming from `pg` are `snake_case`, whereas the
GraphQL typings are `camelCase`.
